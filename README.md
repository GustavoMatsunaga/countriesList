## Challenges! :pushpin:

The application was developed by consuming an API. It generates all the countries and displays their names, flags, and languages, you can filter them, mark as favorite, filter only the favorites, filter by name. In order to achieve the features, it was used ES6 to make the application more efficient. The whole application is responsive, so you either use it on a mobile or desktop.
